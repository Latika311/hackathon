  <p>Brody was an eighth generation gold searching leprechan. His father, grandfather, great grandfather and everyone before could never find the pot of treasure. He has been waiting his entire life to find this gold hidden beneath the surface. Legand has it that no man has been able to find it but, Brody was determined to change that. He began his journey on the Oknowaha Trail before dawn. From what he knew from the stories his father told him, this trail was the passageway to a cave that would lead him underground where he would find this pot of gold. If Brody folllowed his cordinations precisely, he could get there by the end of the day. He brought his dog, Kingsley, to acompany im on this long trip.</p>

  <p>As Brody stomped his way through the dark foggy uncanny forest, he spots a small piece of paper with a tie wrapped around it in a knot. He picks it up and slides the sting around it off. As he unravels it and fixes his eyes on the text, his face scrunches up in confusion. " What Is this?"  The words were jumbled together and looked as if it we in code and not of any language he knew.</p>

  <p>This new discovery gave him what he needed to know. It was the first hint in his journey to the treasure and he was determined to finish now. He stuffed the paper in his pocket and continue the route. Brody walked for two hours non-stop. The sun began to crack by the time he seen the first river. "I guess I could stop for a quick drink", he said to Kingsley. They walked to the river together and Kingsley sped up as they aproached. " I'm parched, buddy." Kingsley was too busy drinking to pay attetion. Brody scooped a handful of water and slurped the refreashment away. He took four more scoops and that's when he seen something within the dirt...another clue.    </p>

<p>"Oh buddy, we've got to get a move on. I feel as if we are getting warmer with all these clues I'm finding." Brody and Kingsley turned around and countiuned down the path. They walked another 2 hours as Brody sung away a song his grandfather use to sing to him. " Mother nature may shout from the river, mountains, hills and trees but she whispers <i>within</i> the leaves. From now to back a few centuries. The treasure which is hidden, will soon be all be for me." <i>(Hint: decrease page to 50%).</i> Kingsley looked up at Brody with his sad face. "-and for you too buddy." They march their way up the hill and there is when they saw that cave just like legand foretold. Brody and Kingsley both ran to the open enterence of the cave. "Here goes nothing, buddy", Brody said to Kingsley taking a large deep breath and looking straight ahead. They walked all the way until they got to the end. "What's this?" Brody whisphered. it was a message on the rocks that read, "THIS IS THE END OF THE JOURNEY. SOLVE THE PUZZLE AND THE TREASURE IS ALL YOURS." </p>
